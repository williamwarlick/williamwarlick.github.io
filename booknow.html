            What you do not need to bring
I supply all of the fishing gear and bait, but you are welcome to bring any of your personal gear.
I will have a cooler with cold bottled water.
There will be a cooler on each boat to put fish in on the trip.
Each boat has a well equipped first aid kit with over-the-counter pain medications and sunscreen, just in
case you forget your own.
Hand soap, hand sanitizer and hand towels
A commonly asked question is “can I bring my dog”, I am big dog lover and would love to have them on
my boat but I have seen to many dogs get hooks stuck in them by accident and there isn’t a worse sound
to me than a dog in pain, so I do not allow them on my guided trips, sorry folks.

What you do need to bring
Valid Maine fishing license….link here….
Any personal medications.
Proper clothing for the season, keep in mind if we are fishing on “Athena Rose”, she is an open boat
without any protection from the weather.
Rain gear is recommended as the weather in Maine is very unpredictable and pop-up showers are
common.
Sunscreen….I do have some on each boat in case you forget
Any drinks you, I do have bottled water on board both boats, alcohol is fine but not in excess.
Food/snacks for ½ day trips ….on full day trips lunch will be provided and that menu will be worked out
before the trip.
Hat and sunglasses are highly recommended.
If you plan on keeping any fish you should bring a cooler with some ice to leave in your vehicle or you
can get ice locally , I can supply a Styrofoam cooler if needed.
A good sense of humor and fun stories, they don’t even have to be true.
Feel free to bring questions about anything fishing or related to the state of Maine.
