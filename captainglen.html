                                My guiding career started when I was 16 years old during a bass
                                tournament.
                                One of the anglers saw me catching some monsters from shore and asked me to join him
                                , with my
                                knowledge of the lake he won the tournament! Since then, it's been my dream to be
                                a fishing
                                guide. 40
                                years later, here I am living that dream! <b>I feel blessed</b> to be able to share
                                that dream
                                with hundreds
                                of people from all over the world every year.

                        It is my goal to provide you a safe, relaxing, and enjoyable trip on some of Maines most
                        beautiful
                        waters.<b> Consider it fishing therapy</b>, a time to step offshore and leave the hustle and
                        stress of life
                        behind.
